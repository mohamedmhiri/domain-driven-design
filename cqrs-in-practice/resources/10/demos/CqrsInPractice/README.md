Welcome to CQRS in Practice
=====================

This is the source code for my Pluralsight course CQRS in Practice (link is coming soon)

How to Get Started
--------------

There are 2 versions of the source code: Before and After. The Before version contains the code developed without the CQRS pattern in mind. The After folder is the final version after all refactorings towards CQRS.

In order to run the application, you need to create a database, and change the connection string in appsettings.json.
